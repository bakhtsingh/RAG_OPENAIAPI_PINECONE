      "First 3 documents: [Document(page_content='You can\\'t solve all the problems in the world by yourself or through your church. It\\'s all a question of burden.\\nI’ve seen numerous missionaries come to India—I live in a third-world country—and I must confess, I have no respect for some of them. The way they lived, what they preached, and their entire way of life was a disgrace to the name of Christ. I honestly felt, \"I wish these folks had never crossed the ocean and come to this country, presenting a wrong picture of Christ.\" At the same time, I’ve seen godly missionaries in India who have been a challenge to my life, even to this day. There are different types, and it all comes down to whether they truly felt called or not.\\nThat\\'s the key question. Just because there’s a need somewhere doesn’t mean the need itself is a call. The need is not the call. While God wants to meet that need, it may not be through you. How do you know if you’re the one?\\nCan I preach to an entire congregation to meet a particular need, if I have a burden for it? We can share information; informing people is one thing. However, meeting the need must be based on the will of God.\\nThe balance is found in Scripture, particularly in the life of Jesus.\\nIn John chapter 4, we see both the need and the call. The need is expressed in verse 35:\\n\"You say, ‘There are still four months until harvest.’ I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields; they are ripe for harvest.\"\\nThat\\'s the need. Jesus is saying, \"Lift up your eyes and look, the fields are white unto harvest.\" But what about the call? The call is found in verse 34:\\n\"My food is to do the will of Him who sent me and to accomplish His work.\"\\nOut of all the need, I must discern which part is my work and do that. It’s a matter of individual calling when it comes to fulfilling a particular need.\\nEven prayer must come from a burden.\\nMany people mechanically repeat prayers like, \"Lord, I pray for this\" or \"I pray for that.\" Such prayers mean absolutely nothing; they\\'re a waste of time. Prayer must come out of a burden. If you have a burden for persecuted Christians, pray for that. But don’t expect everyone in the world to carry your burden, and don’t force it on others.\\nFor example, some people have a burden for evangelism, and I say, “Fine, go ahead and do it.\" My burden is to make disciples out of those who are converted. Don’t force me into your ministry, and I won’t force you into mine. I’m mature enough to know that I shouldn’t be doing your job, and you should be mature enough to realize you don’t have to do mine.\\nIt’s all a question of burden.', metadata={'Question': '1'}), Document(page_content='Prayer is not just what we speak, but also the desire in our hearts.\\nThere’s a beautiful poem that says: \"Prayer is the soul’s sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed.\"\\nPrayer is the soul’s sincere desire, whether spoken or not. So, don’t think that only the words you speak are considered prayer. Sometimes, what we speak is not truly what we desire in our hearts, but God listens to the heart. If there is a desire in your heart, that itself is a prayer.\\nI have this desire every day—to be filled with the Holy Spirit. I know that being filled with the Spirit is not a one-time experience; I need to be constantly filled with the Spirit.\\nIn the Acts of the Apostles, I read about certain people who were \"full of the Spirit.\" This means they were constantly filled with the Spirit, which is different from other believers who may have had one experience but are not continually full of the Spirit.\\nI see this even today—out of ten people who have had an experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit, maybe only one of them remains constantly filled with the Spirit. This is because that one person treats it as a daily necessity.\\nEphesians 5:18 says: \"Be being filled with the Spirit.\"\\nThis is something we need every day.', metadata={'Question': '2'}), Document(page_content='As we walk step by step, like the pillar of cloud and pillar of fire led the Israelites day by day to the Promised Land, we too must walk daily with God.\\nI never knew what God’s plan for my life was. But when I was baptized at the age of 21, which was 54 years ago, I was somehow gripped by the fact that God had a plan for me. This understanding came from Ephesians chapter 2, and it applies to you as well.\\nRemember, these verses I quote from Scripture are in your Bible too. I make them personal so that they work for me, but if you believe in them, they will work for you as well. If you don\\'t believe in them, they won\\'t work for you. As it says, \"According to your faith, be it unto you.\"\\nEphesians 2:10 says:\\n\"We are God\\'s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\"\\nThis means that, long before, God planned certain specific things that I should do in my life. I said, \"Lord, I want to do that.\" I believed His plan was better than any plan I could make for myself.\\nSo, if you submit to God, He will show you what His plan is for your life.', metadata={'Question': '3'})]\n",

But when I was baptized at the age of 21, which was 54 years ago, I was somehow gripped by the fact that God had a plan for me. This understanding came from Ephesians chapter 2, and it applies to you as well.\\nRemember, these verses I quote from Scripture are in your Bible too. I make them personal so that they work for me, but if you believe in them, they will work for you as well. If you don't believe in them, they won't work for you. As it says, \\\"According to your faith, be it unto you.\\\"\\nEphesians 2:10 says:\\n\\\"We are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\\\"\\nThis means that, long before, God planned certain specific things that I should do in my life. I said, \\\"Lord, I want to do that.\\\" I believed His plan was better than any plan I could make for myself.\\nSo, if you submit to God, He will show you what His plan is for your life.\\n=========\\n\\n\\nYou can't solve all the problems in the world by yourself or through your church. It's all a question of burden.\\nI’ve seen numerous missionaries come to India—I live in a third-world country—and I must confess, I have no respect for some of them. The way they lived, what they preached, and their entire way of life was a disgrace to the name of Christ. I honestly felt, \\\"I wish these folks had never crossed the ocean and come to this country, presenting a wrong picture of Christ.\\\" At the same time, I’ve seen godly missionaries in India who have been a challenge to my life, even to this day. There are different types, and it all comes down to whether they truly felt called or not.\\nThat's the key question. Just because there’s a need somewhere doesn’t mean the need itself is a call. The need is not the call. While God wants to meet that need, it may not be through you. How do you know if you’re the one?\\nCan I preach to an entire congregation to meet a particular need, if I have a burden for it? We can share information; informing people is one thing. However, meeting the need must be based on the will of God.\\nThe balance is found in Scripture, particularly in the life of Jesus.\\nIn John chapter 4, we see both the need and the call. The need is expressed in verse 35:\\n\\\"You say, ‘There are still four months until harvest.’ I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields; they are ripe for harvest.\\\"\\nThat's the need. Jesus is saying, \\\"Lift up your eyes and look, the fields are white unto harvest.\\\" But what about the call? The call is found in verse 34:\\n\\\"My food is to do the will of Him who sent me and to accomplish His work.\\\"\\nOut of all the need, I must discern which part is my work and do that. It’s a matter of individual calling when it comes to fulfilling a particular need.\\nEven prayer must come from a burden.\\nMany people mechanically repeat prayers like, \\\"Lord, I pray for this\\\" or \\\"I pray for that.\\\" Such prayers mean absolutely nothing; they're a waste of time. Prayer must come out of a burden. If you have a burden for persecuted Christians, pray for that. But don’t expect everyone in the world to carry your burden, and don’t force it on others.\\nFor example, some people have a burden for evangelism, and I say, “Fine, go ahead and do it.\\\" My burden is to make disciples out of those who are converted. Don’t force me into your ministry, and I won’t force you into mine. I’m mature enough to know that I shouldn’t be doing your job, and you should be mature enough to realize you don’t have to do mine.\\nIt’s all a question of burden.\\n=========\\n\\n\\nPrayer is not just what we speak, but also the desire in our hearts.\\nThere’s a beautiful poem that says: \\\"Prayer is the soul’s sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed.\\\"\\nPrayer is the soul’s sincere desire, whether spoken or not. So, don’t think that only the words you speak are considered prayer. Sometimes, what we speak is not truly what we desire in our hearts, but God listens to the heart. If there is a desire in your heart, that itself is a prayer.\\nI have this desire every day—to be filled with the Holy Spirit. I know that being filled with the Spirit is not a one-time experience; I need to be constantly filled with the Spirit.\\nIn the Acts of the Apostles, I read about certain people who were \\\"full of the Spirit.\\\" This means they were constantly filled with the Spirit, which is different from other believers who may have had one experience but are not continually full of the Spirit.\\nI see this even today—out of ten people who have had an experience of being filled with the Holy Spirit, maybe only one of them remains constantly filled with the Spirit. This is because that one person treats it as a daily necessity.\\nEphesians 5:18 says: \\\"Be being filled with the Spirit.\\\"\\nThis is something we need every day.\\n=========\\n\"\n",
